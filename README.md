# Overview
This repository contains two algorithms: one for generating prime numbers up to a specified limit and another for solving a simple maze. 
Each algorithm demonstrates fundamental programming techniques and problem-solving skills.

## Contents

### Prime Number Generation

# Description: This algorithm identifies and lists all prime numbers up to a given limit.
Algorithm Steps:
# Start with a list of numbers from a starting number to the specified limit.
# For each number, check if it is divisible by any number less than itself (other than 1).
# If it is not divisible by any other number, classify it as prime and add it to the list of prime numbers.

### Maze Traversal

# Description: This algorithm solves a simple maze represented in a grid format.
Algorithm Steps:
# Define the maze structure, marking walls and paths.
# Start at the entry point of the maze.
# Use a recursive approach or backtracking to explore all possible paths from the starting point to the exit.
# Mark visited paths to avoid cycles and backtrack when necessary.
